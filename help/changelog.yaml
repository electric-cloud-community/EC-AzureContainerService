  - When deploying a microservice through ElectricFlow on a Kubernetes cluster provisioned by Azure Container Service, the plugin will now monitor the deployment progress in the cluster and cause the step to fail in case the deployment does not complete within the deployment timeout configured as part of the service mapping. The default timeout value is 120 seconds.
  - When deploying a microservice through ElectricFlow on a Kubernetes cluster provisioned by Azure Container Service, the service name to use in the cluster can now be overridden through the service mapping.
  - When deploying a microservice through ElectricFlow on a Kubernetes cluster provisioned by Azure Container Service, the deployment name to use in the cluster can now be overridden through the service mapping. See section <b>Blue/Green Deployments</b> in the EC-Kubernetes plugin help for details on how this ability can be used to implement a blue/green deployment strategy.
